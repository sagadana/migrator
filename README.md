# Database Migration Scripts

## Description

Collection of Go scripts to migrate data from one database to another.
It connects to both databases, retrieves data from the source, transforms it, and then stores it in the destination.

## Features

- Schema transformation
- Parallel Loading: Break data into chunks and load in parallel
- Auto Resuming: Resume from last success position if failed
- Continuous Replication: Recursively check for new changes and replicate them (TODO: Use Change Stream)

## Set Up

Install `make`

```sh
brew install make
```

Run install command for each migration script

```sh
make install-<script>
```

## Run

To execute the program, run the following command in the project directory:

**Dev**

```sh
make <script>-dev
```

**Docker**

```sh
make <script>-docker
```

## Deploy

Sign in to the correct AWS Account

This will build the docker image and deploy it to an ECR repository.

_Note: Ensure that the infrastructure used to run the migration task has the same [cpuArchitecture](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ecs-task-exec-format-error) as the your system used to build the image._

```sh
make <script>-stag
```
